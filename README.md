before you run the simulations you must have installed these modules:

- pygame
- numba
- numpy

for a simulation that uses Cellular Automatas as method :
 
  usage:   python ripple_tank_ca.py

for a simulation that uses the TLM (Transmission Line Matrix) method:

  usage:   python ripple_tank_tlm.py

then an interactive window appears and you must click inside with
the mouse and see the waves expands all around..
