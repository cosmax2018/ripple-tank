before you run the simulations you must have installed these modules:

- pygame
- numba
- numpy

for a simulation that uses Cellular Automatas as method :
 
  usage:   python ca_ripple_tank_v2.py

for a simulation that uses the TLM (Transmission Line Matrix) method:

  usage:   python tlm_ripple_tank_v1.py

then an interactive window appears and you must click inside with
the mouse and see the waves expands all around..
